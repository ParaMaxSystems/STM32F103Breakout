# STM32F103Breakout
STM32 Breakout Board with Power Stage, inspired by Phil's Lab's design. 
STM32F103C8T board with connectors for I2C, USB, SPI, and GPIO headers.
Broken out to fit vertical or horizontal connectors.
Powered by a 3.3v switching regulator, taking power from USB or Vin and
conrverting to a 3.3v power source. Can be much smaller but I don't want to.
